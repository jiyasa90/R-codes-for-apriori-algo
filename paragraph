The Apriori algorithm and association rules are valuable tools for analyzing grade data. They identify frequent combinations of grades and reveal relationships between different subjects. By setting a minimum support threshold, the Apriori algorithm efficiently discovers common grade patterns. Association rules provide insights into dependencies, such as students who excel in one subject tending to perform well in another. However, their suitability depends on the data being categorical or binary. Interpretation should consider domain knowledge and research goals. Overall, these techniques offer a systematic approach to uncovering grade patterns and associations, aiding educational analysis.
